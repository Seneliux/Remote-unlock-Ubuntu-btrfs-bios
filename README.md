# Remote-unlock-Ubuntu-btrfs-bios
Ubuntu encrypted server,  BTRFS file system, BIOS firmware

# Requirements
BIOS firmware. Not all VPS providers pretend the UEFI firmware. It is easy to adjust the install.sh script by adding efi partition, but this is not covered in this repository.
Booted VPS from Debian-Live 9. Maybe will be fine to boot the newer Debian live OS  or even Ubuntu deriative, but this is not tested. Only difference in software versions at the preparing stage.

# How-to
## Connecting 
ssh to your live system.
